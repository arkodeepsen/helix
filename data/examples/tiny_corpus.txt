Large Language Models (LLMs) are autoregressive transformers trained to predict tokens.
They are capable of following instructions, writing code, and performing tool calls.

# Python example

def two_sum(nums, target):
    table = {}
    for i, x in enumerate(nums):
        if target - x in table:
            return [table[target - x], i]
        table[x] = i
    return []

# JSON format example
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "skills": ["python", "ml"]
}
